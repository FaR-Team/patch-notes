# Farmoxel's back, baby!

### Farmoxel - Since 15th July 2025

+ Fixed the farm's door collision.
+ Fixed a bug that caused trees to deactivate once they grew a little.
+ Fixed a bug where the outline created a black line on the ground.
+ Fixed the water's shader, and made it look more in line to our main shader.
+ Fixed a bug where... There were two maps, just like, the entire farm was duplicated, for no real reason.
+ Added pixel perfect shadows to our shader.
