# KTA is a game we made. Fr

## KTA 6.6.9 (Not yet launched)

#### We haven't updated KTA since... it came out (yeah. ik.), so we're making a bunch of QOL and aesthetical improvements to the game since it doesn't live up to our current standars.

+ Removed the dynamic resolution, it made the game ugly just because, nowadays phone's are powerful enough to handle the game as-is.
+ Fixed that horrible world generation bug. (Kinda?)
+ Resized the restart invisible button to be the entire width of the screen.
+ Reworked the UI for a cleaner look, replacing legacy elements (We weren't even using TMPro???).
+ Added an animation to the loading text.
